    description: "The Cupra Leon represents the first generation of the Leon under SEAT's performance-oriented Cupra sub-brand, which became a standalone marque in 2018. Built on Volkswagen Group's MQB Evo platform, it features more aggressive styling compared to the SEAT Leon, with distinctive Cupra design elements including a copper-accented logo, darkened trim pieces, and sportier bumpers and side skirts. Available in five-door hatchback form, it offers multiple powertrain options including a 2.0L TSI petrol engine with outputs ranging from 245 HP to 300 HP in the range-topping VZ model. A plug-in hybrid variant (eHybrid) combines a 1.4L TSI engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 245 HP and approximately 60 km (37 miles) of electric-only range. The interior features sports seats with copper stitching, a 10.25-inch digital cockpit, 10-inch infotainment touchscreen, and ambient lighting. Standard performance enhancements include sports suspension, progressive steering, and larger brakes, with optional Dynamic Chassis Control adaptive suspension. The Cupra Leon maintains the practicality of the standard Leon while offering enhanced performance and distinctive styling, positioned as a more exclusive and emotional alternative to mainstream hot hatches. Unlike previous generations where Cupra was simply a trim level of SEAT, this model represents Cupra's evolution into its own brand with a unique identity while leveraging the proven Leon platform."
