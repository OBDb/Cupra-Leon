    description: "The Cupra Leon (Mk4, model codes KL1/KL8) represents the first generation of the Leon under SEAT's performance-oriented Cupra marque, which became a standalone brand in 2018. Built on Volkswagen Group's MQB Evo platform (also used by the Audi A3 Mk4, Volkswagen Golf Mk8, and Skoda Octavia Mk4), it features aggressive styling with distinctive Cupra design elements including copper-accented badging, darkened trim, and sportier bumpers and side skirts. Production began in January 2020. Available in five-door hatchback and estate (ST) form, it offers multiple powertrain options. The petrol lineup includes 2.0L TSI engines with 242 bhp and 296 bhp outputs (with the range-topping 306 bhp Cupra ST 4Drive estate-only version available with four-wheel-drive). A plug-in hybrid variant (eHybrid) combines a 1.4L TSI engine with an electric motor for a combined 242 bhp output and approximately 32 miles (51 km) of electric-only range. The Cupra Leon features a sportier suspension setup, sitting 25mm lower at the front and 20mm lower at the rear compared to the standard SEAT Leon. Interior highlights include sports seats with copper stitching, digital cockpit, 10-inch infotainment touchscreen, and ambient lighting. The Cupra Leon 300TSI variant launched in early 2021 with the same turbocharged 2.0-litre engine producing 296 bhp and 400 Nm of torque, enabling 0-62 mph in 5.7 seconds."
